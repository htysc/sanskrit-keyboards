# Sanskrit Keyboards

Windows keyboard layouts for Sanskrit in the Devanāgarī and Bengali scripts designed for those used to the QWERTY layout.

The [Devanāgarī layout](./devanagari/sanskrqw.zip) is based on the [Devanāgarī-QWERTY keyboard layout](https://ubcsanskrit.ca/keyboards.html) by UBC Sanskrit, adding support for the vowels ॠ, ऌ, and ॡ, and the corresponding diacritics. The [Bengali layout](./bengali/sansbnqw.zip) is in turn based on the modified Devanāgarī layout and uses similar key mappings.

## Usage

Download and unzip the ZIP file for your script ([Bengali](./bengali/sansbnqw.zip) or [Devanāgarī](./devanagari/sanskrqw.zip)). Then execute setup.exe in the resulting folder and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to UBC Sanskrit for creating the original Devanāgarī layout and for permitting the publishing of these derived layouts.

The layouts were created using the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134).
